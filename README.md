### Some personal stuff
- Born in Madrid â€“ MadrileÃ±o at heart
- INTJ-A (Assertive); values honesty and curiosity
- Into surfing and boxing; also working on improving my writing
- I'm the creator of akin.space â€” weâ€™ll soon have a coffee shop in Argentina

### My vision

Over the next 5 years, I plan to live in the U.S. full-time for 1 or 2 years, make a meaningful impact, and build a strong network to carry forward after the experience. I aim to launch something of my ownâ€”hopefully with talented collaborators from Spain.
